# Sync Demo

This is a demo codebase from my presentation at the NYC Android Meetup on February 9, 2016, as well as
at Droidcon SF 2016.

The aim here is to demonstrate how to use a sync adapter with stubbed out content providers 
and accounts, and also to show how to unit test the sync logic within the JVM.

We use Realm to handle the persistence layer, rather than using a content provider.
